# rfetch
This is my own fetch, witten in rust and I made this project by vibe coding.

Hello, my name is neko-chi. I want to post my fetch project ( ˶°ㅁ°) !! I code this fetch with vibe code, because I want to make a project and I dont know how to code (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ Why i named it rfetch? Because I write in rust (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)

If you want to help this project more better, you can do that, you really help this project more better (づ> v <)づ♡

By the way I didnt make it as binary, maybe I'll make it as binary later. I really sorry for that (ᵕ—ᴗ—)
